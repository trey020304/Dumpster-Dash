# 🎮 What is the game about? 🎮

<p align="justify">
DumpsterDash is heavily inspired by the infamous game, Subway Surfers, which plays out as an endless running game that embodies the importance of segragation. The mechanic of the game is to continuously collect garbage with accordance to the specific garbage bins that Wally Waste (our mascot!) is holding, whether it may be biodegradable and non-biodegradable. And just like any other endless running games, the objective is to collect as many points as you can by collecting the trash with the right specific trash bin on hand while running through the streets of DumpVania! 🤖♻️

## ♻️ Significance of the Game ♻️

<p align="justify">
According to the 12th goal under the Sustainable Development Goals, it involves establishing sustainable production and consumption habits, which are essential to maintaining the standard of living for both the present and future generations. It calls for more effective and environmentally responsible management of materials throughout their whole lifecycle, from manufacture to disposal. With DumpsterDash's existence, this would not only serve as a fun application but would also raise awareness of the status of our world today in terms of how sustainability and correct segregation of waste is being handled. Since the majority of people play video games on their devices, this game would be helpful in spreading awareness of the 12th Sustainable Development Goal as it would be accessible to practically all age groups and almost anyone with a gadget would be able to play this game!
